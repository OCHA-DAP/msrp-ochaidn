                  In March 2020, BPS (Statistics Indonesia) indicated that the country’s poverty increased by 0.37% compared to last year’s figure, meaning that there are 1.28 million Indonesians that fell into poverty. In rural area, the poverty increases from 12.62% to 12.82%, while in urban area it increased from 6.56% to 7.38%. The trend is expected to increase.
