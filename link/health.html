                  all public and private hospitals in the country. Technical

                  At least 70 doctors and 50 nurses have died from COVID-19 in
                  Indonesia, with hundreds more contracting the disease while
                  fighting the pandemic. The Indonesian Medical Association
                  (IDI) estimated that between 200 and 300 doctors have been
                  infected by the virus, while the National Nurses Association
                  (PPNI) stated that at least 300 nurses have contracted the

                  Health resources have significantly increased. From the
                  initial 132 referral hospitals, there are now 668 referral
                  hospitals, with 166,233 beds and 2,338 isolation rooms.
                  However, these remain low when considered against the total

                  Prior to COVID-19, 5.4 million pregnant women per year
                  required Ante Natal Care, Intra Natal Care, and Post Natal
                  Care services, as well as 30 million couples of childbearing
                  age needed family planning services. Interrupted reproductive
                  health services are causing immediate and long-term issues.

                  An assessment of immunization services among over 5,000 health

                  A 40 percent reduction of new Family Planning users in March

                  The MoH, supported by WHO, is conducting a comprehensive field
                  assessment to identify best practices, gaps and challenges and
                  develop contextualized recommendations for provinces to
                  strengthen the COVID-19 response. The assessment tool was
                  piloted in nine provinces: Banten, East Java, North Maluku,
                  North Sulawesi, Papua, South Sulawesi, West Java, West Papua
                  and Yogyakarta. WHO assisted the MoH in a country-level
                  Intra-Action Review (IAR) during the second week of August.
                  The global IAR guidelines and facilitators’ packages were
                  translated to Indonesian and adapted to the country context
                  and around 100 participants were trained from multiple sectors
                  to conduct the IAR. The results of the field assessment and
                  the IAR will be used to guide the development of national and
